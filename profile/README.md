# Kvede Project

[Kvede](https://kvede.com) project is a system for managing your chats in Telegram. Starting with anti-spam protection, Kvede allows you to interact with users in various aspects, including both removing unwanted content and rewarding them for their actions.

The project is currently in active beta development and is absolutely free for everyone.

To start using Kvede, add [KvedeBot](https://t.me/KvedeBot) to your Telegram groups and grant admin rights to delete messages and block users. At the moment, this is more than enough for it to work.
